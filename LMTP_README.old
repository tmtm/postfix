BEGIN WARNING
=============

The information in this file is outdated. The Postfix LMTP server
can now make connections over UNIX-domain sockets. 

With connections over TCP sockets, some Cyrus implementations insist
on SASL-style authentication, which is not supported by the Postfix
LMTP client. In that case, use UNIX-domain sockets instead.

The precise syntax for UNIX-domain and TCP connection endpoints is
given in the lmtp(8) manual page.

Examples:

    /etc/postfix/transport:
	domain1.name		lmtp1:unix:/path/name
	domain2.name		lmtp2:lmtp2host

    /etc/postfix/master.cf:
        lmtp1      unix  -       -       n       -       -       lmtp
        lmtp2      unix  -       -       n       -       -       lmtp

The first example (domain1) uses UNIX-domain connections, the second
example (domain2) uses TCP. 

For optimal use of connection caching, specify separate mail delivery
transports for each domain that receives mail via LMTP:

===========

Postfix LMTP support
====================

Postfix LMTP support is based on a modified version of the Postfix
SMTP client. The initial version was by Philip A.  Prindeville of
Mirapoint, Inc., USA. This code was modified further by Amos Gouaux
of University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, USA.  Wietse Venema
reduced the code to its present shape.

Postfix can be configured to talk to a local or remote LMTP server.
Most people will run the LMTP server on the same machine that runs
Postfix. However, a remote LMTP server can be useful if Postfix
runs on mail relay server(s) that feed incoming mail directly to
the appropriate mailbox server(s). This way, mailbox servers do
not need to run an SMTP server at all.  Tidy all the way around.

Configuring the mailbox server (local or remote)
================================================

On the mailbox server, in this case a CMU Cyrus imapd/popd server,
add the following to /etc/services:

    pop3            110/tcp                         # Cyrus POP3
    imap            143/tcp                         # Cyrus IMAP4
    lmtp            24/tcp

Next, put the following in /etc/inetd.conf:

    lmtp    stream  tcp     nowait  cyrus   /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/local/cyrus/bin/deliver -e -l

/usr/sbin/tcpd is from the tcp_wrappers package.  You want this to
make sure only your mail relay(s) can talk to the LMTP server.
Postfix by default does multiple deliveries per LMTP session
(connection caching), so do not worry about the overhead of
tcp_wrapping the LMTP port.

On some systems, tcpd is built into inetd, so you do not have to
specify tcpd in the inetd.conf file. Instead of tcpd/inetd, xinetd
can do a similar job of logging and access control.

Configuring Postfix
===================

Similar changes to /etc/services:

    lmtp            24/tcp

You may have to add the following entry to /etc/postfix/master.cf:

    lmtp      unix  -       -       n       -       -       lmtp

NOTE:  Root privileges are not necessary!

Put this in /etc/postfix/transport:

    inbox.domain.org     lmtp:inbox.domain.org

Naturally, this means we also need in /etc/postfix/main.cf:

    transport_maps      = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

Instead of "hash", use the map type of your choice. Some systems
use "dbm" instead. Use "postconf -m" to find out what map types
are supported.

Improving connection caching performance
========================================

After delivering a message via LMTP, Postfix will keep the connection
open for a while, so that it can be reused for a subsequent delivery.
This reduces overhead of LMTP servers that create one process per
connection.  

For LMTP connection caching to work, the Postfix LMTP client should
not switch destination hosts.  This is no problem when you run only
one LMTP server. However, if you run multiple LMTP servers, this
can be an issue.

You can prevent the LMTP client from switching between servers by
configuring a separate mail delivery transport for each LMTP server:

    /etc/postfix/master.cf:
        lmtp1      unix  -       -       n       -       -       lmtp
        lmtp2      unix  -       -       n       -       -       lmtp
          .         .    .       .       .       .       .        .

Configure transport table entries such that the lmtp1 mail delivery
transport is used for all deliveries to the LMTP server #1, the
mail lmtp2 transport for the LMTP server #2, and so on.

    /etc/postfix/transport:
        foo.com lmtp1:lmtp1host
        bar.com lmtp2:lmtp2host

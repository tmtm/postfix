Incompatible changes with postfix-alpha-19990317:
=================================================

- You MUST install the new version of /etc/postfix/postfix-script.

- The pipe mailer "flags" syntax has changed. You now explicitly
MUST specify the R flag in order to generate a Return-Path:  message
header (as needed by, for example, cyrus).

Major changes since postfix-beta-19990122-pl01:
===============================================

A detailed record of changes is given in the HISTORY file.

- Less postmaster mail. Undeliverable bounce messages (double
bounces) are now discarded. Specify "notify_classes = 2bounce..."
to get copies of double bounces. Specify "notify_classes = bounce..."
to get copies of normal and double bounces.

- Improved LDAP client code by John Hensley of Merit Network, USA.
See LDAP_README for details.

- Perl-compatible regular expression support for lookup maps by
Andrew McNamara, connect.com.au Pty. Ltd., Australia..  Example:
"check_recipient_access pcre:/etc/postfix/sample-pcre.cf". Regular
expressions provide a powerful tool not only for SMTP access control
but also for address rewriting. See PCRE_README for details.

- Automatic notification of delayed mail (disabled by default).
With "delay_warning_time = 4", Postfix informs senders when mail
has not been delivered after 4 hours. Initial version of the code
by Daniel Eisenbud, University of California at Berkeley. In order
to get postmaster copies of such warnings, specify "notify_classes
= delay...".

- More configurable local delivery: "mail_spool_directory" to
specify the UNIX mail spool directory; "mailbox_transport" to
delegate all mailbox delivery to, for example, cyrus, and
"fallback_transport" to delegate delivery of only non-UNIX users.
And all this without losing local aliases and local .forward
processing.  See config/main.cf and config/master.cf.

- Several changes to improve Postfix behavior under worst-case
conditions (frequent Postfix restarts/reloads combined with lots
if inbound mail, intermittent connectivity problems, SMTP servers
that become comatose after receiving QUIT).

- More NFS-friendly mailbox delivery. The local delivery agent
now avoids using root privileges where possible.

- For sites that do not receive mail at all, mydestination can now
be an empty string. Be sure to set up a transport table entry to
prevent mail from looping.

- New "postsuper" utility to clean up stale files from Postfix
queues.

- Workaround for BSD select() collisions that cause performance
problems on large BSD systems.

- Use "$alias_maps, unix:passwd.byname" in smtpd access tables to
recognize known local users. We're almost there with stopping
unknown users at the RCPT TO command - the syntax for virtual maps
and sendmail access tables is too different.

- Several questionable but useful features to capture mail:
"always_bcc = address" to capture a copy of every message that
enters the system, and "luser_relay = address" to capture mail for
unknown recipients (does not work when mailbox_transport or
fallback_transport are being used).

- Junk mail controls: new reject_non_fqdn_{hostname,sender,recipient}
restrictions to reject non-FQDN arguments in HELO, MAIL FROM and
RCPT TO commands, and stricter checking of numeric HELO arguments.

- "fallback_relay" feature for sites that use DNS but that can't
talk to the entire world. The fall-back relay gets the mail when
a destination is not found in the DNS or when the destination is
found but not reachable.

- Several questionable controls that can help to keep mail going:
specify "smtp_skip_4xx_greeting = yes" to skip SMTP servers that
greet with 4XX, "ignore_mx_lookup_error = yes" to look up an A
record when a DNS server does not respond to an MX query.

Incompatible changes with postfix-beta-19990122-pl01:
=====================================================

None.

Major changes with postfix-beta-19990122-pl01:
==============================================

- Restrict who may use ETRN and what domains may be specified.
Example:  "smtpd_etrn_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject".

- BIFF notifications.  For compatibility reasons this feature is
on by default.  Specify "biff = no" in main.cf if your machine has
lots of shell users.

- With "soft_bounce = yes", defer delivery instead of bouncing
mail. This is a safety net for configuration errors with delivery
agents. It has no effect on errors in virtual maps, canonical maps,
or in junk mail restrictions.

- Specify "owner_request_special = no" to turn off special treatment
of owner-foo and foo-request addresses.

Incompatible changes with postfix-beta-19990122:
================================================

- The syntax of the transport table has changed. An entry like:

	customer.org	smtp:[gateway.customer.org]

  no longer forwards mail for anything.customer.org. For that you
  need to specify:

	customer.org	smtp:[gateway.customer.org]
	.customer.org	smtp:[gateway.customer.org]

  This change makes tranport tables more compatible with
  sendmail mailer tables.

- The format of syslog records has changed. A client is now always
logged as hostname[address]; the pickup daemon logs queue file uid
and sender address.

Major changes with postfix-beta-19990122:
=========================================

- Junk mail restrictions can now be postoned to the RCPT TO command.
Specify: "smtpd_recipient_restrictions = reject_maps_rbl...".

- More flexible interface for delivery to e.g., cyrus IMAP without
need for PERL scripts to munge recipient addresses. In addition to
$sender, $nexthop and $recipient, the pipe mailer now also supports
$user, $extension and $mailbox.

- New mail now has precedence over deferred mail, plus some other
tweaks to make bulk mail go faster. But it ain't no cure for massive
network outages.

- Watchdog timer for systems that cause the Postfix queue manager
to lock up, so it recovers without human intervention.

- Delivery to qmail-style maildir files, which is good for NFS
environments.  Specify "home_mailbox = Maildir/", or specify
/file/name/ in aliases or in .forward files. The trailing / is
required to turn on maildir delivery.

- Incremental updates of aliases and maps. Specify "postmap -i
mapname" and it will read new entries from stdin. 

- Newaliases will now update more than one alias database.
Specify the names with the main.cf "alias_database" parameter.

- Address masquerading exceptions to prevent users from being
masqueraded. Specify "masquerade_exceptions = root".

- A pipelined SMTP client. Deliveries to Postfix, qmail, LSOFT,
zmailer, and exim (once it's fixed) speed up by some 30% for short
messages with one recipient, with more for multi-recipient mails.

- Hook for local delivery to "|command" via the smrsh restricted
shell, to restrict what commands may be used in .forward etc. files.
Specify "local_command_shell = /some/where/smrsh -c".

REJECT by header/body_checks are now flagged as policy violations
rather than bounces, for consistency in postmaster notifications.

Major changes with snapshot-20001217
====================================

This release involves little change in functionality and a lot of
small changes to lots of files. The code is put out as a separate
snapshot release so that I have a tested baseline for further work.

All time-related configuration parameters now accept a one-letter
suffix to indicate the time unit (s: second, m: minute, h: hour,
d: day, w: week). The exceptions are the LDAP and MYSQL modules
which are maintained separately.

The mysql client was partially rewritten in order to elimimate some
memory allocation/deallocation problems. The code needs more work,
and needs to be tested in a real production environment.

The local_transport and default_transport configuration parameters
can now be specified in transport:destination notation, just like
the mailbox_transport and fallback_transport parameters.  The
:destination part is optional.  However, these parameters take only
one destination, unlike relayhost and fallback-relay which take
any number of destinations.

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20001210
===========================================

If this release does not work for you, you can go back to a previous
Postfix version without losing your mail, subject to the "incompatible
changes" listed for previous Postfix releases below.

When delivering to /file/name (as directed in an alias or .forward
file), the local delivery agent now logs a warning when it is unable
to create a /file/name.lock file. Mail is still delivered as before.

The "sun_mailtool_compatibility" feature is going away (a compatibility
mode that turns off kernel locks on mailbox files). It still works,
but a warning is logged. Instead of using "sun_mailtool_compatibility",
specify the mailbox locking strategy as "mailbox_delivery_lock =
dotlock".

The Postfix SMTP client now skips SMTP server replies that do not
start with "CODE SPACE" or with "CODE HYPHEN" and flags them as
protocol errors. Older Postfix SMTP clients silently treated "CODE
TEXT" as "CODE SPACE TEXT", i.e. as a valid SMTP reply.

This snapshot does not yet change default relay settings. That
change alone affects a dozen files, most of which documentation.
This may be an incompatibility with some people's expectations,
but such are my rules - between code freeze and release no major
functionality changes are allowed.

Several interfaces of libutil and libglobal routines have changed.
This may break third-party code written for Postfix. In particular,
the safe_open() routine has changed, the way the preferred locking
method is specified in the sys_defs.h file, as well as all routines
that perform file locking. When compiling third-party code written
for Postfix, the incompatibilities will be detected by the compiler
provided that #include file dependencies are properly maintained.

Major changes with snapshot-20001210
====================================

This snapshot includes bugfixes that were already released as
patches 12 and 13 for the 19991231 "stable" release:

  - The queue manager could deadlock for 10 seconds when bouncing
    mail under extreme load from one-to-one mass mailings.

  - Local delivery performance was substandard, because the per-user
    concurrency limit accidentally applied to the entire local
    domain.

The mailbox locking style is now fully configurable at runtime.
The new configuration parameter is called "mailbox_delivery_lock".
Depending on the operating system type, mailboxes can be locked
with one or more of "flock", "fcntl" or "dotlock".  The command
"postconf -l" shows the available locking styles.  The default
mailbox locking style is system dependent.  This change affects
all mailbox and all "/file/name" deliveries by the Postfix local
delivery agent.

The new "import_environment" and "export_environment" configuration
parameters now provide explicit control over what environment
variables Postfix will import, and what environment variables
Postfix will pass on to a non-Postfix process. This is better than
hard-coding my debugging environment into public releases.

The "mailbox_transport" and "fallback_transport" parameters now
understand the form "transport:nexthop", with suitable defaults
when either transport or nexthop are omitted, just like in the
Postfix transport map. This allows you to specify for example,
"mailbox_transport = lmtp:unix:/file/name".

The MYSQL client now supports server connections over UNIX-domain
sockets.  Code provided by Piotr Klaban. See the file MYSQL_README
for examples of "host" syntax.

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20001121
===========================================

If this release does not work for you, you can go back to a previous
Postfix version without losing your mail, subject to the "incompatible
changes" listed for previous Postfix releases below.

Major changes with snapshot-20001121
====================================

Support for RedHat Linux 7.0.  On RedHat Linux 7.0, you must install
the db3-devel RPM before you can compile the Postfix source code.

The mailbox_transport feature works again. It was broken when the
"require_home_directory" feature was added.

More general virtual domain support.  Postfix now supports both
Sendmail-style virtual domains and Postfix-style virtual domains.
Details and examples are given in the revised virtual manual page.

- With Sendmail-style virtual domains, local users/aliases/mailing
  lists are visible as localname@virtual.domain. This is convenient
  if you want to host mailing lists under virtual domains.

- With Postfix-style virtual domains, local users/aliases/mailing
  lists are not visible as localname@virtual.domain. Each virtual
  domain has its own separate name space.

More general "soft bounce" feature.  Specify "soft_bounce = yes"
in main.cf to prevent the SMTP server from bouncing mail while you
are testing configurations. Until this release the SMTP server was
not aware of soft bounces.

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20001029
===========================================

If this release does not work for you, you can go back to a previous
Postfix version without losing your mail, subject to the "incompatible
changes" listed for previous Postfix releases below.

Berkeley DB support has changed for Solaris, HP-UX, UNIXWARE, IRIX.
On these systems, Postfix must no longer use DB 1.85 compatibility
mode, because that mode loses the file lock while building a table,
so that table lookups fail and mail is lost. See the DB_README file
for instructions on how to build Postfix with third-party Berkeley
DB support.

The "fast ETRN" policy configuration has changed. You now specify
the list of eligible "fast ETRN" domains with the fast_flush_domains
parameter (default: $relay_domains). In order to disable the feature,
specify an empty value (fast_flush_domains =).

Major changes with snapshot-20001029
====================================

This release ships with an updated LDAP client module that has better
group support by Lamont Jones, and that has several other enhancements.
Review the LDAP_README file for more information.

The LMTP client can now make connections over UNIX-domain sockets
in addition to IPV4.  For connections over UNIX-domain sockets,
specify a transport table entry like:

    domain.name		lmtp:unix:/path/name

IPV4-based servers are still the default. The LMTP_README file
still needs to be revised to account for this change. This is
best done by someone who actually uses the Postfix LMTP client.

You can now specify multiple SMTP destinations in the relayhost
and fallback_relay configuration parameters. The destinations are
tried in the specified order. Specify host or host:port (perform
MX record lookups), [host] or [host]:port (no MX record lookups),
[address] or [address]:port (numerical IP address).

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20001005
===========================================

If this release does not work for you, you can go back to a previous
Postfix version without losing your mail, subject to the "incompatible
changes" listed for previous Postfix releases below.

You must execute "postfix stop" before installing this release.
Some recommended parameter settings have changed, and a new entry
must be added to the master.cf file before you can start Postfix
again.

1 - The recommended Postfix configuration no longer uses flat
    directories for the "active", "bounce", and "defer" queue
    directories.  The "flush" directory for the new "flush" service
    directory should not be flat either.

    Upon start-up, Postfix checks if the hash_queue_names configuration
    parameter is properly set up, and will add any queue directory
    names that are missing.

2 - In order to improve performance of one-to-one mail deliveries
    the queue manager will now look at up to 10000 queue files
    (was: 1000).  The default qmgr_message_active_limit setting
    was changed accordingly.

    If you have a non-default qmgr_message_active_limit in main.cf,
    you may want adjust it.

3 - The new "flush" service needs to be configured in master.cf.

    Upon start-up, Postfix checks if the new "flush" service is
    configured in the master.cf file, and will add an entry if it
    is missing.

Should you wish to back out to a previous Postfix release there is
no need to undo the above changes.

Major changes with snapshot-20001005
====================================

In order to improve performance of one-to-one deliveries, Postfix
by default now looks at up to 10000 messages at a time (was: 1000).

Until now, Postfix did a rather lame effort at implementing the
SMTP ETRN command - it attempted to deliver all mail in the queue,
regardless of its destination.  This is slow if your mail server
queues mail for lots of different destinations.

This release introduces fast "ETRN" and "sendmail -qR". These
deliver only mail that is queued for the specified destination,
without requiring Postfix to open every file in the mail queue.

Postfix now maintains per-destination logfiles with information
about what mail is queued for specific destinations.  By default,
these logfiles are maintained only for destinations that Postfix
is willing to relay to (as controlled by the relay_domains parameter).

The maintenance policy for deferred mail logfiles is selected with
the "fast_flush_policy" configuration parameter.  Possible values
are:  "all" (maintain logs for all destinations), "relay" (maintain
logs for relay destinations) or "none" (maintain no logs).

Postfix falls back to the old slow ETRN for destinations that are
not eligible for the fast "ETRN" and "sendmail -qR" service.

See the file ETRN_README for details.

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20000924
===========================================

The postmaster address in the "sorry" text at the top of bounced
mail is now just postmaster, not postmaster@sending.machine.  The
idea is to refer users to their own postmaster.

Major changes with snapshot-20000924
====================================

DSN formatted bounced/delayed mail notifications, finally.  The
human-readable text still exists, so that users will not have to
be unnecessarily confused by all the ugliness of RFC 1894.

Major changes with snapshot-20000923
====================================

The nqmgr (experimental smarter queue manager) has been updated.
It no longer worked after the change in queue manager to delivery
agent protocol.

Specify "syslog_facility = log_local1" etc. to separate the logging
from multiple Postfix instances. However, a non-default logging
facility takes effect only after process initialization. Errors
during command-line parsing are still logged with the default syslog
facility, as are errors while processing the main.cf file.

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20000921
===========================================

After "make install" you need to execute "postfix reload".  The
protocol between queue manager and delivery agents has changed.
This does not affect the format of existing queue files.  You just
cannot mix this Postfix version's queue managers or delivery agents
with older Postfix versions.

The notation of [host:port] in transport tables etc. is going away
but it is still supported. The preferred form is now [host]:port.
This change is necessary to support IPV6 address forms which use
":" as part of a numeric IP address. In a future release, Postfix
will log a warning when it encounters the [host:port] form.

In mail headers, Errors-To:, Reply-To: and Return-Receipt:  addresses
are now rewritten as a sender address (was: recipient).

Postfix no longer inserts Sender: message headers.

The queue manager now logs the original number of recipients when
opening a queue file (example: from=<>, size=3502, nrcpt=1).

The local delivery agent no longer appends a blank line to mail
that is delivered to external command.

The pipe delivery agent no longer appends a blank line when the F
flag is specified (in the master.cf file). Specify the B flag if
you need that blank line.

Major changes with snapshot-20000921
====================================

Postfix now strips out Content-Length: headers in incoming mail to
avoid confusion in mail user agents.

The header_checks and body_checks features can now be used to strip
out unwanted data. Specify IGNORE and the data will disappear.

Specify "require_home_directory = yes" to prevent mail from being
delivered to a user whose home directory is not mounted.

The pipe mailer has a size limit (size=nnn) command-line argument.

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20000531
===========================================

All references to "content inspection" have been replaced by "content
filtering", in anticipation of hooks for true content inspection
that does not re-inject mail back into Postfix.

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20000529
===========================================

This version introduces an incompatible queue file format change
when content filtering is enabled. Old Postfix queue files will
work fine, but new queue files with content filtering info will
not work with old Postfix versions. They log a warning and move
incompatible queue files to the "corrupt" mail queue subdirectory.

Major changes with snapshot-20000529
====================================

This version introduces full content filtering through an external
process. This involves an incompatible change in queue file format.
Mail is delivered to content filtering software via an existing
mail delivery agent, and is re-injected into Postfix via an existing
mail submission agent.  See examples in the FILTER_README file.
Depending on how the filter is implemented, you can expect to lose
a factor of 2 to 4 in delivery performance of SMTP transit mail,
more if the content filtering software needs lots of CPU or memory.

Major changes with snapshot-20000528
====================================

Specify "body_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/body_checks" for a quick
and dirty emergency content filter that looks at non-header lines
one line at a time (including MIME headers inside the message body).
Details in conf/sample-filter.cf.

This version introduces a new queue manager with a clever scheduler
by Patrik Rak that allow mailing list deliveries be pre-empted by
non-list mail, while preserving correct average delivery delays.
The queue manager is build as nqmgr. It needs further testing.

Major changes with snapshot-20000514
====================================

LaMont Jones and Patrik Rak reported two different scenarios in
which pipelined SMTP sessions could time out forever. Postfix now
automatically flushes delayed SMTP commands/replies to prevent
sender delays from accumulating too much.  For example, client-side
delays happen when a client does DNS lookups to replace hostname
aliases in a MAIL FROM or RCPT TO commands; server-side delays
happen when an UCE restriction involves DNS lookup, or when a server
generates a tarpit delay.

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20000507
===========================================

As required by RFC 822, Postfix now inserts a generic destination
message header when no destination header is present.  The text is
specified via the undisclosed_recipients_header configuration
parameter (default:  "To: undisclosed-recipients:;").

The Postfix sendmail command treats a line with only `.' as
the end of input, for the sake of sendmail compatibility. To disable
this feature, specify the sendmail-compatible `-i' or `-oi' flags
on the sendmail command line.

For the sake of Sendmail compatibility, the Postfix SMTP client
skips over SMTP servers that greet with a 4XX or 5XX reply code,
treating them as unreachable servers.  To obtain prior behavior
(4XX=retry, 5XX=bounce), specify "smtp_skip_4xx_greeting = no" and
"smtp_skip_5xx_greeting = no".

The read/write interface underneath VSTREAMs has been extended with
parameters that specify a read/write timeout and application context.
This should make it easier to plug in encryption modules such as TLS.

Major changes with snapshot-20000507
====================================

Better documentation of Postfix lookup tables, including descriptions
of how to use regular expressions in Postfix lookup tables.

Updated mysql and LDAP client code with fixes and improvements.

In master.cf you can selectively override main.cf configuration
parameters, for example: "smtpd -o myhostname=foo.com".

In main.cf, specify "smtp_bind_address=x.x.x.x" to bind SMTP
connections to a specific local interface. Or override the default
setting in master.cf with "smtp -o smtp_bind_address=x.x.x.x".
For now, you must specify a numeric IP address.

Preliminary LMTP client support over TCP with connection caching.
Support for LMTP over UNIX-domain sockets will be added later as
an enhancement to the transport table syntax. See the LMTP_README
file for more details.

By the way, LMTP client-side connection caching is a good example
for how to do the same in the SMTP client.

Preliminary support for SASL authentication, both in the SMTP server
and in the SMTP client. See the SASL_README file for more details.

The pipe delivery agent has a configurable end-of-line attribute.
Specify "pipe ... eol=\r\n" for delivery mechanisms that require
CRLF record delimiters. The eol attribute understands the following
C-style escape sequences:  \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \nnn \\.

Incompatible changes with snapshot-20000309
===========================================

This release is mainly to have a reference point after reorganizing
the cleanup daemon, and before adding some major contributions from
other people.

Major changes with snapshot-20000309
====================================

Questionable feature: with "smtp_skip_5xx_greeting = yes", Postfix
emulates behavior found in some other MTAs. 

Questionable feature: with "smtp_always_send_ehlo = yes", the SMTP
client sends EHLO regardless of the content of the SMTP server's
greeting.

Specify "-d key" to postalias or postmap in order to remove one
key. This still needs to be generalized to multi-key removal (e.g.,
read keys from stdin).

The manual pages in Postfix configuration files no longer contain
troff formatting codes.  The text is now generated from prototype
files in a new "proto" subdirectory.

Incompatible changes with postfix-19991231:
===========================================

- The SMTP server no longer forwards mail from untrusted clients
with sender-specified routing (stuff[@%!]stuff[@%!]stuff) through
destinations that are authorized by the relay_domains parameter.
This closes a loophole that exploits trust relationships between
hosts.  Example:  a trusted backup MX host forwards junk mail to
a primary MX host which forwards the junk to the Internet. Specify
"allow_untrusted_routing = yes" to restore the old behavior.

- The SMTP server no longer forwards mail with sender-specified
routing (stuff[@%!]stuff[@%!]stuff) through destinations that are
authorized by the permit_mx_backup feature. This change is under
control by the allow_untrusted_routing parameter discussed above.

- In order to support the above, the data structure and protocol
of the trivial-rewrite service was changed. This means you must
re-compile and re-link existing software that uses the Postfix
resolve_clnt interface.

- As a side effect of the above, an address from an untrusted client
with @ in the localpart (user@remote@here) no longer bounces with
"user unknown" but instead is rejected with "relay access denied".

- Incompatible SMTPD access map changes:

  An all-numeric right-hand side now means OK.  This is for better
  cooperation with out-of-band authentication mechanisms such as
  POP before SMTP etc.

  An empty right-hand sides still mean OK, but Postfix will log a
  warning in order to discourage such usage.

  You can no longer use virtual, canonical or aliases tables as
  SMTPD access maps. Use the local_recipient_maps feature instead.

- Recipient addresses may no longer begin with `-'. In order to
get the old behavior, specify "allow_min_user = yes" in main.cf.

- Incompatible transport map changes:

  Transport map entries override mydestination.  If you use transport
  maps, it is better to always have explicit entries for all domain
  names you have in $mydestination.  See the html/faq.html sections
  for firewalls and intranets.

  The nexthop information given to a local delivery agent may have
  changed.  This information was never intended to be used as a
  next-hop destination.

Major changes with postfix-19991231:
====================================

- It is now much more difficult to configure Postfix as an open
relay. The SMTP server requires that "smtpd_recipient_restrictions"
contains at least one restriction that by default refuses mail (as
is the default).  There were too many accidents with changes to
the UCE restrictions.

- The relay_domains parameter no longer needs to contain $virtual_maps.

- Overhauled FAQ (html/faq.html) with many more examples.

- Updated UCE documentation (html/uce.html) with more examples.
More UCE configuration examples in sample configuration files.

- Several little improvements to the installation procedure:
relative symlinks, configurable directory for scratch files so the
installation can be done without write access to the build tree.

- Updated LDAP client code (John Hensley).

- Updated mysql client code (Scott Cotton).

- The SMTP server now rejects mail for unknown users in virtual
domains that are defined by Postfix virtual maps.

- The SMTP server can reject mail for unknown local users.  Specify
"local_recipient_maps = $alias_maps, unix:passwd.byname" if your
local mail is delivered by a UNIX-style local delivery agent.  See
example in conf/main.cf.

- Use "disable_vrfy_command = yes" to disable the SMTP VRFY command.
This prevents some forms of address harvesting.

- The sendmail "-f" option now understands <user> and even understands
forms with RFC 822-style comments.

- New "qmgr_fudge_factor" parameter allows you to balance mailing
list performance against response time for one-to-one mail.  The
fudge factor controls what percentage of delivery resources Postfix
will devote to one message.  With 100%, delivery of one message
does not begin before delivery of the previous message is completed.
This is good for list performance, bad for one-to-one mail. With
10%, response time for one-to-one mail improves much, but list
performance suffers: in the worst case, people near the start of a
mailing list get a burst of postings today, while people near the
end of the list get that same burst of postings a whole day later.

- It is now relatively safe to configure 550 status codes for the
main.cf unknown_address_reject_code or unknown_client_reject_code
parameters.  The SMTP server now always sends a 450 (try again)
reply code when an UCE restriction fails due to a soft DNS error,
regardless of what main.cf specifies.

- The RBL checks now show the content of TXT records (Simon J Mudd).

- The Postfix SMTP server now understands a wider range of illegal
address forms in MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands. In order to disable
illegal forms, specify "strict_rfc821_envelopes = yes". This also
disables support for MAIL FROM and RCPT TO addresses without <>.

- Per-client/helo/sender/recipient UCE restrictions (fully-recursive
UCE restriction parser). See the RESTRICTION_CLASS file for details.

- Use "postmap -q key" or "postalias -q key" for testing Postfix
lookup tables or alias files.

- Use "postconf -e name=value..." to edit the main.cf file.  This
is easier and safer than editing the main.cf file by hand. The
edits are done on a temporary copy that is renamed into place.

- Use "postconf -m" to display all supported lookup table types
(Scott Cotton).

- New "permit_auth_destination" UCE restriction for finer-grained
access control (Jesper Skriver).

Incompatible changes with postfix-19990906
==========================================

- On systems that use user.lock files to protect system mailboxes
against simultaneous updates, Postfix now uses /file/name.lock
files while delivering to files specified in aliases/forward/include
files. This is a no-op when the recipient lacks directory write
permission.

- The LDAP client code no longer looks up a name containing "*"
because it could be abused.  See the LDAP_README file for how to
restore previous behavior.

- The Postfix to PCRE interface now expects PCRE version 2.08.
Postfix is no longer compatible with PCRE versions prior to 2.06.

Major changes with postfix-19990906
===================================

Several bugfixes, none related to security.  See the HISTORY file
for a complete list of changes.

- Postfix is now distributed under IBM Public License Version 1.0
which does not carry the controversial termination clause. The new
license does have a requirement that contributors make source code
available.

- INSTALL.sh install/upgrade procedure that replaces existing
programs and shell scripts instead of overwriting them, and that
leaves existing queue files and configuration files alone.

- The ugly Delivered-To: header can now be turned off selectively.
The default setting is:  "prepend_delivered_header = command, file,
forward".  Turning off the Delivered-To:  header when forwarding
mail is not recommended.

- mysql client support by Scott Cotton and Joshua Marcus, Internet
Consultants Group, Inc. See the file MYSQL_README for instructions.

- reject_unauth_destination SMTP recipient restriction that rejects
destinations not in $relay_domains. Unlike the check_relay_domains
restriction, reject_unauth_destination ignores the client hostname.
By Lamont Jones of Hewlett-Packard.

- reject_unauth_pipelining SMTP *anything* restriction to stop mail
from spammers that improperly use SMTP command pipelining to speed
up their deliveries.

- Postfix "sendmail" now issues a warning and drops privileges if
installed set-uid root.

- No more duplicate delivery when "postfix reload" is immediately
followed by "sendmail -q".

- No more "invalid argument" errors when a Postfix daemon opens a
DB/DBM file while some other process is changing the file.

- Portability to the Mac OS X Server, Reliant Unix, AIX 3.2.5 and
Ultrix 4.3.

Incompatible changes with postfix-19990601:
===========================================

- The SMTP server now delays all UCE restrictions until the RCPT
TO, VRFY or ETRN command. This makes the restrictions more useful,
because many SMTP clients do not expect negative responses earlier
in the protocol.  In order to restore the old behavior, specify
"smtpd_delay_reject = no" in /etc/postfix/main.cf.

- The Postfix local delivery agent no longer automatically propagates
address extensions to aliases/include/forward addresses.  Specify
"propagate_unmatched_extensions = canonical, virtual, alias, forward,
include" to restore the old behavior.

- The Postfix local delivery agent no longer does $name expansion
on words found in the mailbox_command configuration parameter. This
makes it easier to specify shell syntax. See conf/main.cf.

- The luser_relay syntax has changed. You can specify one address;
it is subjected to $user, etc. expansions. See conf/main.cf.

- File system reorganization: daemon executables are now in the
libexec subdirectory, command executables in the bin subdirectory.
The INSTALL instructions now recommend installing daemons and
commands into separate directories.

Major changes with postfix-19990601:
=====================================

- New USER, EXTENSION, LOCAL, DOMAIN and RECIPIENT environment
variables for delivery to command (including mailbox_command) by
the local delivery agent. As you might expect, the information is
censored. The list of acceptable characters is specified with the
command_expansion_filter configuration parameter.  Unacceptable
characters are replaced by underscores. See html/local.8.html.

- Specify "forward_path = /var/forward/$user" to avoid looking up
.forward files in user home directories.  The default value is
$home/.forward$recipient_delimiter$extension, $home/.forward.
Initial code by Philip A.  Prindeville, Mirapoint, Inc., USA.

- Conditional $name expansion in forward_path and luser_relay.
Available names are: $user (bare user name) $shell (user login
shell), $home (user home directory), $local (everything to the left
of @), $extension (optional address extension), $domain (everything
to the right of @), $recipient (the complete address) and
$recipient_delimiter.  A simple $name expands as usual.  ${name?value}
expands to value when $name is defined.  ${name:value} expands to
value when $name is not defined. With ${name?value} and ${name:value},
the value is subject to another iteration of $name expansion.

- POSIX regular expression support, enabled by default on 4.4BSD,
LINUX, HP-UX, and Solaris 2.5 and later. See conf/sample-regexp.cf.
Initial code by Lamont Jones, Hewlett-Packard, borrowing heavily
from the PCRE implementation by Andrew McNamara, connect.com.au
Pty. Ltd., Australia.

- Regular expression checks for message headers.  This requires
support for POSIX or for PCRE regular expressions.  Specify
"header_checks = regexp:/file/name" or "header_checks = pcre:/file/name",
and specify "/^header-name:  badstuff/ REJECT" in the pattern file
(patterns are case-insensitive by default).  Code by Lamont Jones,
Hewlett-Packard.  It is to be expected that full content filtering
will be delegated to an external command.

- Regular expression support for all lookup tables, including access
control (full mail addresses only), address rewriting (canonical/virtual,
full mail addresses only) and transport tables (full domain names
only).  However, regular expressions are not allowed for aliases,
because that would open up security exposures.

- Automatic detection of changes to DB or DBM lookup tables.  This
eliminates the need to run "postfix reload" after each change to
the SMTP access table, or to the canonical, virtual, transport or
aliases tables.

- New error mailer. Specify ".domain.name error:domain is undeliverable"
in the transport table to bounce mail for entire domains.

- No more Postfix lockups on Solaris (knock on wood). The code no
longer uses Solaris UNIX-domain sockets, because they are still
broken, even with Solaris 7.

- Workaround for the Solaris mailtool, which keeps an exclusive
kernel lock on the mailbox while its window is not iconified (specify
"sun_mailtool_compatibility = yes" in main.cf).

- Questionable workaround for Solaris, which reportedly loses
long-lived exclusive locks that are held by the master daemon.

- New reject_unknown_{sender,recipient}_domain restrictions for
sender and recipient mail addresses that distinguish between soft
errors (always 450) and hard errors (unknown_address_reject_code,
default 450).

- MIME-encapsulated bounce messages, making it easier to recover
bounced mail. Initial implementation by Philip A.  Prindeville,
Mirapoint, Inc., USA. Support for RFC 1892 (multipart/report) and
RFC 1894 (DSN) will have to wait until Postfix internals have been
revised to support RFC 1893.

- Separately configurable "postmaster" addresses for single bounces
(bounce_notice_recipient), double bounces (2bounce_notice_recipient),
delayed mail (delay_notice_recipient), and for mailer error reports
(error_notice_recipient). See conf/main.cf.

- Questionable feature: specify "best_mx_transport = local" if
this machine is the best MX host for domains not in mydestinations.

Incompatible changes with postfix-19990317:
===========================================

- You MUST install the new version of /etc/postfix/postfix-script.

- The pipe mailer "flags" syntax has changed. You now explicitly
MUST specify the R flag in order to generate a Return-Path:  message
header (as needed by, for example, cyrus).

Major changes with postfix-19990317:
====================================

A detailed record of changes is given in the HISTORY file.

- Less postmaster mail. Undeliverable bounce messages (double
bounces) are now discarded. Specify "notify_classes = 2bounce..."
to get copies of double bounces. Specify "notify_classes = bounce..."
to get copies of normal and double bounces.

- Improved LDAP client code by John Hensley of Merit Network, USA.
See LDAP_README for details.

- Perl-compatible regular expression support for lookup maps by
Andrew McNamara, connect.com.au Pty. Ltd., Australia..  Example:
"check_recipient_access pcre:/etc/postfix/sample-pcre.cf". Regular
expressions provide a powerful tool not only for SMTP access control
but also for address rewriting. See PCRE_README for details.

- Automatic notification of delayed mail (disabled by default).
With "delay_warning_time = 4", Postfix informs senders when mail
has not been delivered after 4 hours. Initial version of the code
by Daniel Eisenbud, University of California at Berkeley. In order
to get postmaster copies of such warnings, specify "notify_classes
= delay...".

- More configurable local delivery: "mail_spool_directory" to
specify the UNIX mail spool directory; "mailbox_transport" to
delegate all mailbox delivery to, for example, cyrus, and
"fallback_transport" to delegate delivery of only non-UNIX users.
And all this without losing local aliases and local .forward
processing.  See config/main.cf and config/master.cf.

- Several changes to improve Postfix behavior under worst-case
conditions (frequent Postfix restarts/reloads combined with lots
if inbound mail, intermittent connectivity problems, SMTP servers
that become comatose after receiving QUIT).

- More NFS-friendly mailbox delivery. The local delivery agent
now avoids using root privileges where possible.

- For sites that do not receive mail at all, mydestination can now
be an empty string. Be sure to set up a transport table entry to
prevent mail from looping.

- New "postsuper" utility to clean up stale files from Postfix
queues.

- Workaround for BSD select() collisions that cause performance
problems on large BSD systems.

- Several questionable but useful features to capture mail:
"always_bcc = address" to capture a copy of every message that
enters the system, and "luser_relay = address" to capture mail for
unknown recipients (does not work when mailbox_transport or
fallback_transport are being used).

- Junk mail controls: new reject_non_fqdn_{hostname,sender,recipient}
restrictions to reject non-FQDN arguments in HELO, MAIL FROM and
RCPT TO commands, and stricter checking of numeric HELO arguments.

- "fallback_relay" feature for sites that use DNS but that can't
talk to the entire world. The fall-back relay gets the mail when
a destination is not found in the DNS or when the destination is
found but not reachable.

- Several questionable controls that can help to keep mail going:
specify "smtp_skip_4xx_greeting = yes" to skip SMTP servers that
greet with 4XX, "ignore_mx_lookup_error = yes" to look up an A
record when a DNS server does not respond to an MX query.

Incompatible changes with postfix-beta-19990122-pl01:
=====================================================

None.

Major changes with postfix-beta-19990122-pl01:
==============================================

- Restrict who may use ETRN and what domains may be specified.
Example:  "smtpd_etrn_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject".

- BIFF notifications.  For compatibility reasons this feature is
on by default.  Specify "biff = no" in main.cf if your machine has
lots of shell users.

- With "soft_bounce = yes", defer delivery instead of bouncing
mail. This is a safety net for configuration errors with delivery
agents. It has no effect on errors in virtual maps, canonical maps,
or in junk mail restrictions.

- Specify "owner_request_special = no" to turn off special treatment
of owner-foo and foo-request addresses.

Incompatible changes with postfix-beta-19990122:
================================================

- The syntax of the transport table has changed. An entry like:

	customer.org	smtp:[gateway.customer.org]

  no longer forwards mail for anything.customer.org. For that you
  need to specify:

	customer.org	smtp:[gateway.customer.org]
	.customer.org	smtp:[gateway.customer.org]

  This change makes transport tables more compatible with
  sendmail mailer tables.

- The format of syslog records has changed. A client is now always
logged as hostname[address]; the pickup daemon logs queue file uid
and sender address.

Major changes with postfix-beta-19990122:
=========================================

- Junk mail restrictions can now be postponed to the RCPT TO command.
Specify: "smtpd_recipient_restrictions = reject_maps_rbl...".

- More flexible interface for delivery to e.g., cyrus IMAP without
need for PERL scripts to munge recipient addresses. In addition to
$sender, $nexthop and $recipient, the pipe mailer now also supports
$user, $extension and $mailbox.

- New mail now has precedence over deferred mail, plus some other
tweaks to make bulk mail go faster. But it ain't no cure for massive
network outages.

- Watchdog timer for systems that cause the Postfix queue manager
to lock up, so it recovers without human intervention.

- Delivery to qmail-style maildir files, which is good for NFS
environments.  Specify "home_mailbox = Maildir/", or specify
/file/name/ in aliases or in .forward files. The trailing / is
required to turn on maildir delivery.

- Incremental updates of aliases and maps. Specify "postmap -i
mapname" and it will read new entries from stdin. 

- Newaliases will now update more than one alias database.
Specify the names with the main.cf "alias_database" parameter.

- Address masquerading exceptions to prevent users from being
masqueraded. Specify "masquerade_exceptions = root".

- A pipelined SMTP client. Deliveries to Postfix, qmail, LSOFT,
zmailer, and exim (once it's fixed) speed up by some 30% for short
messages with one recipient, with more for multi-recipient mails.

- Hook for local delivery to "|command" via the smrsh restricted
shell, to restrict what commands may be used in .forward etc. files.
Specify "local_command_shell = /some/where/smrsh -c".
